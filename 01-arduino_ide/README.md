# Installing Arduino IDE

Download the Arduino IDE:  
- [try me first - this is a newer version and *may* work (arduino-ide_2.3.4)](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-ide/arduino-ide_2.3.4_Windows_64bit.zip)  
- [otherwise try me - this is an older version but did work for everyone (arduino-1.8.18)](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.18-windows.zip)  

Be patient while it downloads... :upside_down_face:

The above are Windows ZIP files for non admin installation on a computer you do not own.
For either, open the location where the ZIP file downloads (most likely the `Downloads` folder on your computer).
Extract using Windows by right clicking on the ZIP file and clicking extract.

Be patient while it extracts... :face_exhaling:

Now, open the extracted folder(s) until you enter the main folder (it should contain `Arduino IDE.exe` 
if using the newer version or `arduino.exe` if using the older one). Inside this, create a folder called `portable`. 

This tells Arduino IDE to save sketches, settings and libraries here rather than elsewhere on the computer that you do not own. 
If you can, save the entire root extracted folder onto a USB drive, your phone or a cloud account. 
If you can't, try attaching your `portable` folder to a draft email.

Update your copy before you log out!
